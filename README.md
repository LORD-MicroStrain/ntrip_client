# ROS NTRIP Client

The most significative changes I made are in the src/ntrip_client/ntrip_client.py file.
It now handles disconnection from the net, lack of signal from the sat (and hence missing valid GGA string to the NTRIP server which will then stop sending corrections) regaining connectivity once the conditions for the net or the gps are more favorable.


## Description

ROS node that will communicate with an NTRIP server to receive RTCM connections and publish them on a ROS topic. Also works with network/VRS mountpoints by subscribing to NMEA
messages and sending them to the NTRIP server

#### Important Branches
There are two important branches that you may want to checkout:

* [ros](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ntrip_client/tree/ros) -- Contains ROS1 implementation for this node.
* [ros2](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ntrip_client/tree/ros2) -- Contains ROS2 implementation for this node.

Also compatible with https://github.com/KumarRobotics/ublox and  ZED-F9P 

## Build Instructions

#### Building from source
1. Install ROS and create a workspace: [Installing and Configuring Your ROS Environment](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment)

2. Move the entire ntrip_client folder to the your_workspace/src directory.

3. Install rosdeps for this package: `rosdep install --from-paths ~/your_workspace/src --ignore-src -r -y`

4. Build your workspace:
    ```bash
    cd ~/your_workspace
    catkin_make
    source ~/your_workspace/devel/setup.bash
    ```        
    The source command may need to be run in each terminal prior to launching a ROS node.

#### Launch the node and publish data
The following command will launch the node. Keep in mind each instance needs to be run in a separate terminal.
```bash
roslaunch ntrip_client ntrip_client.launch
```

Optional launch parameters:
- **host**: Hostname or IP address of the NTRIP server to connect to.
- **port**: Port to connect to on the server. Default: `2101`
- **mountpoint**: Mountpoint to connect to on the NTRIP server.
- **authenticate**: Whether to authenticate with the server, or send an unauthenticated request. If set to true, `username`, and `password` must be supplied.
- **username**: Username to use when authenticating with the NTRIP server. Only used if `authenticate` is true
- **password**: Password to use when authenticating with the NTRIP server. Only used if `authenticate` is true

#### Topics

This node currently only has two topics of interest:

* **/rtcm**: This node will publish the RTCM corrections received from the server to this topic as [RTCM messages](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/mavros_msgs/html/msg/RTCM.html). These messages can be consumed by nodes such as the [microstrain_inertial_driver](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/microstrain_inertial)
* **/nmea**: This node will subscribe on this topic and receive [NMEA sentence messages](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/nmea_msgs/html/msg/Sentence.html) which it will forward to the NTRIP server. This is only needed when using a virtual NTRIP server

## Docker Integration

### VSCode

The easiest way to use docker while still using an IDE is to use VSCode as an IDE. Follow the steps below to develop on this repo in a docker container

1. Install the following dependencies:
    1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
1. Open VSCode and install the following [plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace):
    1. [VSCode Remote Containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
1. Open this directory in a container by following [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)

### Make

If you are comfortable working from the command line, the [Makefile](./devcontainer/Makefile) in the [.devcontainer](./devcontainer) directory
can be used to build a development image, and run a shell inside the docker image. Follow the steps below to setup your environment to use the `Makefile`

1. Install the following dependencies:
    1. [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    1. [qemu-user-static](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/qemu-user-static) (for multiarch builds)
        1. Run the following command to register the qemu binaries with docker: `docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register`

The `Makefile` exposes the following tasks. They can all be run from the `.devcontainer` directory:
* `make build-shell` - Builds the docker image and starts a shell session in the image allowing the user to develop and build the ROS project using common commands such as `catkin_make`
* `make clean` - Cleans up after the above two tasks
